DJ DELOREAN, a **resident DJ** of TES Club and a mentor for music production in 303HZ, is a project of Tbilisi-based producer & DJ Dimitri Gongliashvili. DJing from an early age, the project's name was inspired by the movie _Back to the Future_, where characters travel between the past and future. His sets, whether DJing or live, flow between _house_, _techno_, and _breakbeat_, offering a unique experience that blends old and new sounds for the perfect dancefloor.
